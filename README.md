# Hey there! I'm Nathalie üë©‚Äçüíª

### This is what I mostly do but can't wait to get even better at:

- React
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- API's
- Firebase/Supabase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### I am familiar with this but I would love to learn more!

- Testing, like Cypress and Jest
- Databases like MySQL, Neo4J
- Svelte
- Designing with Figma and Tailwind CSS
- Redux
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Right now I'm working on: 

- Getting more knowledge in backend using MongoDB, Express and Node.js (also called the MERN-stack) to broaden my skills and be able to code even better smarter and cooler projects!

#### Feel free to check out my repos if you're curious about my previous work :sparkles:
