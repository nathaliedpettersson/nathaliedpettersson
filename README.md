# Hi, and welcome! I'm Nathalie 👩‍💻

### This is what I mostly do but can't wait to get even better at:

- React
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- API's
- Firebase/Supabase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### I am familiar with this but would love to learn more!

- Testing, like Cypress and Jest
- Databases like MySQL, Neo4J
- Svelte
- Designing with Figma and Tailwind CSS
- Redux
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### My next personal goal is to: 

- Get more knowledge in backend using Node.js to broaden my skills and be able to code even better, smarter and cooler projects!

#### Feel free to check out my repos if you're curious about my previous work :sparkles:
